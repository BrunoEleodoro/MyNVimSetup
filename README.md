# MyNVimSetup

I Do not expect you to use this repo, so I'll not give any tutorial on how to setup nvim on your machine.

If you find it useful, that's ok as well.

# Cheat sheet

  - Forget about your arrow keys, we can use different keys for this:
    - `K` = TOP 
    - `L` = RIGHT
    - `J` = DOWN
    - `H` = LEFT

  - Navigate using other shortcuts:
    - `(` = move cursor block up
    - `)` = move cursor block down
  
  - Screens:
    - `:vsplit` = split your screen vertically.
    - `:30winc <` = decrease 30 something of the current view.
    - to navigate with the views, you can use `ctrl+W H`, `ctrl+W L` to navigate on the direction you desire.

  - `:PlugInstall` = install the plugins.
  - `Undo` = `u`
  - `Redo` = `ctrl+R`
  - Beginning of line: `^`
  - End of line: `$`
